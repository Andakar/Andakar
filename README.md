- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andakar
- 👀 I’m interested in creating LED art projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Arduinos, ESP8266, ESP32, and programming on Platformio using FastLED & WLED. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for like minded people to chat with along the way. Have also joined Reddit groups because my skills aren't yet at a place where I can offer a great deal as a collaborator. 
- 📫 How to reach me @Andakar or andakar@gmail.com
